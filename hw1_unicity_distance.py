def unicity_distance_of_affine_cipher(n: int = 26, r: float = 1.8) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the unicity distance of an Affine cipher.

    Args:
        n: The size of the alphabet used in the cipher. Defaults to 26.
        r: The redundancy of the language. Defaults to 1.8.

    Returns:
        The unicity distance for the Affine cipher.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is less than or equal to 0.

    Notes:
        The unicity distance is a measure of the minimum length of ciphertext needed to uniquely determine the key used in an encryption scheme.
        It is calculated as the entropy of the key space divided by the redundancy of the language.

    Example:
        >>> unicity_distance_of_affine_cipher(26, 1.8)
